# LDLC_Fucker
An LDLC Bot for buying GPUs. With 3DS automation (Hype/YAP)

# How it Works?

When the bot is started, it asks to connect your Telegram account, so it can detect a channel with alerts for LDLC, who needs to be specified inside the code.
When the bot sees a new alert it checks up if it's a 3060/70/80/90 seires card and depending on the choice, it starts the checkout process, with automated log-in and credit card infos.
If you dont trust me read the code by yourself ;)

# 3D Secure automation (only for Hype/YAP cards)

This bot features a 3DS automation because some of the banks needs a OTP for payment verification.
Via another telegram account, who you can connect to, the bot sends to your primary account a message, asking you to insert your OTP code. Sometimes, it even asks you for your account code. You can insert it into main.py file.
